# Unixpense
Unixpense or *University Expense* is an application to track all of your expenses throughout days, weeks, months, and
even years. Just like the name of the application, people can track their expenses from dates, categories, amounts, and
comments. The available categories are groceries, food, transportation, personal, hangout, and health. Therefore, you
can choose what kind of category your expense is, and you can filter them to see a specific expense's category. I made
this application because as a university student, I really want to reduce my expenses and do more savings. This 
application therefore will be useful for people, especially university students, who want to keep track of their 
expenses and save more money.

## Phase 4: Task 3:
If I had more time to modify the project, I'd refactor the GUI class because I used a lot of inner-classes, which makes
the code's readability a bit ineffective and confusing. Therefore, it would be better if I separate all the inner-classes
to individual classes in the same package. It would then make things easier, such as debugging or adding new features.
