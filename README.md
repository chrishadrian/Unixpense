# Unixpense

Unixpense or *University Expense* is an application to track all of your expenses throughout days, weeks, and months.
Just like the name of the application, people can track their expenses from dates, categories, and amounts. 
The categories starts from groceries, hangout, personal, and utilities. I made this application because as a university
student, I really want to reduce my expenses and do more savings. This application therefore will be useful for people, 
especially University Students, who want to keep track of their expenses and do more savings.
